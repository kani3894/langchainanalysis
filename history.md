Project Kickoff

Defined vision: Build an AI assistant for check-and-answer research tasks.

Established initial use cases: extracting quotes, micro-tagging, and theming from interview transcripts.

Outlined MVP: Accept 10 transcripts â†’ extract relevant quotes â†’ tag â†’ cluster â†’ visualize in Streamlit â†’ CSV export.

Chose tech stack: Python backend with LangChain + Streamlit frontend.

Decided to use local storage (JSON/CSV) for quick iteration.

LLM + Tagging Pipeline

Connected LangChain to local LLMs (e.g., Mistral via Ollama).

Built chain for quote extraction and micro-tag generation.

Added quote-level metadata (speaker, timestamp, tag).

Started testing clustering methods for macro themes.

Refinements and Next Steps

Enhanced UI with visual grouping of quotes by theme.

Added manual override/editing for tags in the Streamlit interface.

Began work on clustering algorithm evaluation.

Drafted plan for integrating user feedback loop into the tagging process.

âœ… Upcoming
Add support for multilingual transcript processing.

Improve quote-context matching for better precision.

Implement project memory using Cursor AI Agent Mode.

Add support for search/filter/sort in Streamlit view.

Deploy to a private cloud instance for internal use.
